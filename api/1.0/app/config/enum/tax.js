This is due to the fact that the technology has evolved faster than the tax law or the regulators\' ability to address the issue.  While some states have addressed the issue of taxability they differ in what determines taxability.  For example Pennsylvania has ruled that remote access is taxable if the end user is located in Pennsylvania regardless of the location of the Application Service ProviderÆs (ASP) server (SUT-12-001). On the other hand Utah has determined that remote access on servers located outside of Utah is not taxable (PLR 10-011).  Due to the complexity and uncertainty surrounding cloud computing FedTax cannot ensure the tax determination for remote access.
